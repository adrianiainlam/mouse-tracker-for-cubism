# Cut-off volume for lip syncing.
# If the volume is below this value, it will be forced to zero.
# This can be useful if you don't have a good quality microphone
# or are in a slightly noisy environment.
# Note: this cut-off is applied *after* applying the gain.

# Audio buffer size. This is the window size over which we calculate
# the "real-time" volume. A higher value will give a smoother
# response, but will mean a higher latency.
# The sampling rate is set to 44100 Hz so 4096 samples should
# still have a low latency.

# Set this to 1 for a fully smiling mouth, 0 for a normal mouth,
